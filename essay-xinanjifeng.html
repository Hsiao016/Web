       Today I went to see an experimental play by a Chengdu dramatist whose Instagram name is “Southwest Monsoon.” The phrase pierced me at once. The southwest monsoon is humid and warm, ushering in sultry afternoon cloudbursts and earth whose dampness gives off a faint, metallic tang.

       In recent years, the vogue for “Southern writing” and “Southern cinema” across Chinese popular culture seems inseparable from the rain—whether the setting is Malaysia, Fujian, or Wuhan. All sprout beneath a subtropical monsoon, yet each remains its own species of weather. In the works I have encountered, the Southwest is cast as a land of nature, mystery, and spirit. Yet that vision also veils another Southwest: during the Cold War’s tense cartography, the region lay along the Third Front of China’s military project. Rain and monsoon moisten not only the pages of Huang Jinshu and the neon around The Wild Goose Lake; they also shroud secrets that are named only by numbers.
