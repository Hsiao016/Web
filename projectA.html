      <p>Sheffield is now regarded as a "de-industrialised" city, following the failure of miner activism in the 1980s and a series of "reutilisations" of the original industrial infrastructure. This project uses interactive maps to show how three industrial sites, including Orgreave Coal Works, Hadfields Steelworks and Portland Works, are reconfigured in different ways. Sheffield's industrial history with its associated uncomfortable memories, is repurposed or forgotten in different cases. Each interactive map illustrates how industrial sites are spatially integrated into broader context of activism, neoliberal globalisation, urban entrepreneurship, and community-driven urban renewal. Sheffield's industrial past is not disappeared with the repurposing of these sites; rather, it continues to haunt the present, persistently returning around us.

      <p>This project is a portfolio that I used to complete the course, Digital Cultural Heritage: From Theory to Practice, for the University of Sheffield's Digital Culture and Communication MA programme.
