      <p>I'm a PhD student at the University of Westminster, Contemporary China Centre. I got BA in Chinese Language and Literature from Soochow University and MA in Digital Culture and Communication from the University of Sheffield.
</p>
<p>I'm interested in:(1)How industrial heritage making in post-socialist China is part of the politics of memory, how socialist memory is contested by multiple actors and (2)How the heritage making serves a broader post-socialist urban entrepreneurialism. My PhD project is 'The Haunting Socialist Memory: China’s Third Front Industrial Heritage, Public Secrets and Exposure'. </p>
<p>I'm also interested in issues including the "regeneration" of the UK's industrial cities and the impact of international students on them, feminism and queer in post-socialist China, and methodological experiments in the use of digital humanities.
In addition, I love photography, attending cultural events and walking in the city. I've lived in Chengdu, Suzhou, Sheffield and Reading, and I now live in London.</p>
<p>My research revolves around the metaphor of the "Ghost"or "Haunting". By viewing those uncomfortable past, which some have declared "dead", as haunting, I conduct my study of industrial heritage, whether in China or the UK. "吊鬼既然早被打死，为什么现在还会引出真的来呢？"</p>
