      <p>At a time when the past is seen as dead and people are trying to commemorate or avoid it, Zhongxiao Hu investigates the politics of memory in cities, heritage and wider cultural geographies, centering on the metaphor of 'ghosts'. They received their B.A. in Chinese Language and Literature from Soochow University and M.A. in Digital Culture and Communication from the University of Sheffield.</p>
<p>Zhongxiao is currently working on their PhD project entitled The Haunting Socialist Memory: China’s Third Front Industrial Heritage, Public Secrets and Exposure, which focuses on how China's Cold War heritage is negotiated within contemporary practices of urban entrepreneurialism. They is also interested in broader socio-cultural issues in post-socialist China, including queer, feminism and urban culture, as well as the dynamics of the 'regeneration' of Britain's industrial cities and international education.
</p>
<p>In addition, Zhongxiao writes essays on art and culture for social media or hikes in the city. They is experimenting with digital humanities methodologies to enrich existing research.</p>
<p>They will forever stand with the margins, and forever pursue justice for the ghosts pronounced dead. Their position is '横站 Hengzhan' (standing sideways).</p>
